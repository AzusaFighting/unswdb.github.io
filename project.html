                            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Temporal graphs' are powerful tools to expressively model time-evolving relationships among different entities, underpinning a wide spectrum of applications from e-commerce to public health. The volume of temporal graph data in real-world applications can be very large. However, existing techniques for temporal graph processing mainly focus on single-machine solutions. This project will bridge this important gap by developing novel techniques for scalable and efficient temporal graph processing in the cloud. The success of this project will bring technological advances in the processing of big graphs, positioning Australia as a leader of the research field of graph processing and analytics. Through partnership and the licensing of IP, the enhanced graph processing capability from this project will deliver significant commercial and social benefits for key Australian industry sectors, including financial frauds detection in e-commerce, network attacks and malware detection in cyber-security systems, contact tracing in public health, and terrorist detection from social network analysis in defence.</p>
